# Understanding the problem

This error message indicates a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. Your web application, hosted at `https://the-hubja.netlify.app`, is trying to make a request to a resource located at a different origin: `https://script.google.com`. Browsers, for security reasons, enforce the same-origin policy, which by default prevents scripts from making requests to a different domain, scheme, or port than the one the script originated from.

When your script attempted to fetch the resource, the browser first sent a "preflight" request (an `OPTIONS` HTTP request) to the Google Script URL to check if the server would allow the actual request from your origin. The error "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource" means that the response from `script.google.com` did not include the necessary `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, which tells the browser that it's permissible for your origin (`https://the-hubja.netlify.app`) to access the resource [1, 2].

# Suggested fix

To fix this, you need to configure the Google Apps Script to include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response. This header should specify the origin(s) that are allowed to access the script. Since you are calling the script from `https://the-hubja.netlify.app`, you should allow this origin.

Here's how you can modify your Google Apps Script to include the necessary header:

javascript function doGet(e) { // Your existing script logic here...

var response = ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success', message: 'Data processed' }));

// Add the CORS header to allow requests from your Netlify origin response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://the-hubja.netlify.app');

return response; }

function doPost(e) { // Your existing script logic here...

var response = ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({ status: 'success', message: 'Data processed' }));

// Add the CORS header to allow requests from your Netlify origin response.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://the-hubja.netlify.app');

return response; }

**Important:** If you need to allow multiple origins, you cannot list them in a single `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. You would typically need to check the `Origin` header in the incoming request and dynamically set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to match the requesting origin if it's in your list of allowed origins [3]. However, for simplicity with Google Apps Script, allowing a single specific origin is usually sufficient.

After making these changes in your Google Apps Script, redeploy the script as a web app with the appropriate permissions.

# Summary

The CORS error occurred because your browser, enforcing the same-origin policy, was blocked from accessing a resource on a different origin (`script.google.com`) because the server's response lacked the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header allowing your origin (`https://the-hubja.netlify.app`) to access it. The fix involves modifying your Google Apps Script to include the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its response, specifying that requests from `https://the-hubja.netlify.app` are permitted.
