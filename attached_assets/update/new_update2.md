reviews are being submitted and the google sheet are being updated but when a review and rating is submitted on a product, that product screen goes blank, 

so i want to add an update, in the reviews Sheet i want to also add "business ID" column, so that if a business have the same product as another business, only that busiess product review will be loaded, so i want you to update Review&Ratings_script.md to now use business ID, and also update the appropriate codes to reflect the changes,



now that you understand the the implimentation, in the vote sheet, and both reviews sheet, and businessreviews sheet i want to add Ip address column, this will be use to restrict a user to only 1 like or dislike per business, but not both, and use to restrict a user to only 5 reviews per business per day. the review system will maintain all its current implimentations. without changing any of the current implimentation, i want you to update the codes in Review&Ratings_script.md to now use the ip address column, and also update the appropriate codes to reflect the changes. in addition i want the review system to follow the exact implimentation for both the frontend and the google app script as in
